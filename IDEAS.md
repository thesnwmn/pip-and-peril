# Ideas

A running pool of ideas for **Pip & Peril**, written by the **Thinker** and consumed by the
**Designer**. Each idea is a seed, not a spec — enough to act on, short enough to scan.

Idea numbers are assigned sequentially and **never reused**, even when an idea is removed or
promoted into a feature. When an idea becomes a feature, note the feature number and move on.

## Format

```
## Idea NNN — Short Title

**Area:** [Flow / Dice / Character / World / Art / UI / Meta / System]
**Inspiration:** [what sparked this, if anything]

One to three sentences: what it is, why it might be good, and any obvious risk or open question.
Optionally a rough shape (interface, screen, or data sketch) — but no acceptance criteria and no
code; the Designer writes those.
```

> **Recently promoted / consolidated** (kept here only as a pointer so numbers aren't reused):

> promoted as Wave 1; higher-complexity item categories (coatings, dice manipulation, knowledge
> items, cursed items) remain future work.

## Idea 008 — Interior Tile Archetypes

**Area:** Art
**Inspiration:** Manager — "every tile is exactly the same"; concept note `docs/concept/tiles-and-props.md`.

Treat a tile as four independent layers — exit layout × **interior archetype** × room type × props —
and add the missing archetype layer: the *shape and substance between the doorways*. Starting set:
Chamber (today), Passage (a real corridor, floor only where it connects exits), Cavern (rough,
narrower, rubble), Pillared Hall, Rubble/Collapse. The hard invariant is that doorway openings stay
at the fixed snapping position and width, so any interior tiles cleanly. Recommend shipping as a
pure visual skin first (new `drawCell` branches, no rule changes). Risk: must stay legible at
phone-thumbnail size — favour *shape* changes over texture.

## Idea 009 — Prop Layer (Decor & Features)

**Area:** Art
**Inspiration:** Manager — "props that can be randomly placed… torches on the wall, rocks, etc."

A draw pass that scatters small objects over a finished tile from a weighted set: wall torches
(with a soft light glow), rubble, bones/skulls, glowing mushrooms, cobwebs, puddles, coin glints.
Props use **anchor zones** (wall band, floor corners, centre) rather than raw coordinates; the
placer never covers a doorway and caps density (~0–3 per tile) for readability. Torch glow tints
the surrounding stone so props feel lit by the room. Rough shape: `Prop = { kind, anchors[], weight }`
plus a `placeProps(tile)` that fills anchors. Risk: over-cluttered thumbnails — needs a tight cap
and a "no prop over exits" rule.

## Idea 010 — Squeeze Tiles (Pip-Only Shortcuts)

**Area:** System
**Inspiration:** Pillar "Pip's small size is a mechanic"; manager — "slightly narrower than usual".

A Squeeze archetype: a crack far narrower than a normal doorway, with a mouse-hole motif, that only
Pip can pass. Renders as atmosphere but carries a mechanic — a shortcut or secret route that large
enemies (and pursuing bosses) cannot follow, turning Pip's smallness into traversable geography
rather than flavour text. Open question: does a Squeeze guarantee a safe escape, or just a different
path? Pairs naturally with backtracking and any future "chase" pressure.

## Idea 011 — Boss Foreshadowing

**Area:** World
**Inspiration:** Enemies & Bosses concept; the boss-reveal intro already gives any boss instant presence via title card.

The boss is randomised at run start, but small echoes surface during the descent: an NPC mentions
a terrible hiss from below; a corridor has raven feathers on the floor; a shopkeeper whispers a
name. The randomisation is unchanged — the hints are just its echo, seeded in the world as
atmosphere. The effect: the boss reveal feels like a discovery rather than a lottery. Risk: hints
must be vague enough not to feel like promises if the player never reaches the boss.

## Idea 041 — Rattled / Emboldened Combat States

**Area:** System / Character
**Inspiration:** Entirely the Thinker's own — not a direct development of the manager's direction.
**Parked behind:** feature 037 (Combat Overhaul) — these states layer on top of the new turn loop.

Transient per-fight modifiers that track how the fight is going, without permanent complexity. **Rattled** triggers when Pip takes damage on two consecutive turns without landing a hit — one die locks to its minimum face until Pip lands an attack (representing flinching fear). **Emboldened** triggers when Pip lands a killing blow — the *next* combat starts with one free virtual Yellow pip on the first roll (confidence following a win). Both states clear naturally; neither compounds. They make fights feel like they have texture and momentum beyond HP tracking, and they create natural hooks for items (*Steadying Brew* clears Rattled) and meta-skills (*Counter-Strike* triggers on a full dodge; *Battle Cry* extends Emboldened). Risk: Rattled's visual representation — a "shaky" die — must read clearly on a small phone screen without being distracting mid-allocation.
